Cutout stencil design: Stylized melting wax forming the shape of a capital letter "A". The wax's main body creates one side of the "A", while dripping wax forms the other side. The crossbar of the "A" is represented by a horizontal line of melted wax connecting the two sides. All lines are thick and connected, forming a single piece with no floating elements. The wax's body has round wavy edges to represent melting wax, with droplets flowing down the sides. Design optimized for easy tracing and cutting, with slightly rounded corners and no intricate details. The overall shape clearly resembles both melting wax and the letter "A", perfect for a Halloween-themed stencil.
